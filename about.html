      <p>
          Hello! Welcome to my corner of the web.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          I am an intrapreneurial (ex) practice head / engineering head who is looking for opportunities that encompass technical, managerial and commercial considerations.
      </p>

      <p>
          I have worked in various types of areas and companies and felt that printed resumes tend to be too linear for people to quickly understand what I have done in various contexts and this was my attempt to solve the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
          In my career have worked in the areas of incubation, business development, architect / developer, digital transformation, product engineering, artificial intelligence / cognitive computing and telecom. I was briefly also a scientist where I essentially believed I did very little in a very vast area.
