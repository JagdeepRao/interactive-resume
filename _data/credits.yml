- This whole static website creator concept rocks! Earlier, I have used CMS like AEM, JSPs and even 
  wrote my own HTMLs, but this by far is a sweet spot.

- I github pages + Jekyll = almost certainly the cheapest and fastest way to build websites. 
  
- Sure you can use Cloudfront to upload your content, but then you are essentially stuck with Single Page Applications.
  You could use AWS with AEM or any other CMS, you end up paying for an AP server and you need to solve the whole issue 
  related to how would you like to cache contents.
  
- Jekyll with Github was absolutely painless. From start to finish, after I found the right theme, I was pretty much 
  done in 4 hours. Spent about 2 hours on content, essentially moving content from my old resume and classifying it under
  the right tag/metadata such that folks can read appropriate content. 
  
- Now would I use this is my real job? Depends! COTS products like AEM and other CMSs have "mindshare" and also
  lot of money gets spent on marketing, alliances and certifications.
